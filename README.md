STUDENT TRANSCRIPT APPLICATION
This project centers around creating and deploying a transcript management system (application software) tailored for university institutions, such as the University of Buea (UB). 
The primary objective is to streamline and enhance the efficiency of the transcript application process. 
The software will feature a user-friendly interface for students, aiming to simplify the entire transcript collection procedure within these academic institutions.
Transcripts, essential documents that delineate a student's academic performance across all courses in a specific semester, have traditionally been distributed manually in university settings. Managing the application process for these documents can be excessively time-consuming, often handled by a single administrator appointed by the institution. 
The implementation of a transcript management system has the potential to revolutionize this process, offering efficiency gains and an enhanced experience for students.
The primary goal of our transcript management project is to streamline and enhance the overall transcript application process, thereby potentially increasing institutional productivity. 
Specific objectives include:
Accessibility: Making the application process accessible from any location through the software application.
Efficient Payments:  Facilitating payments by implementing a fast and secure online payment system.
Time Sensitivity: Reducing processing time for document collection after application. 
This involves transitioning from a manual application method, where waiting times vary, to a more efficient system with consistent processing times.
Effectiveness: Enhance effectiveness by enabling access to the transcript document via the mobile application upon completion of the process. 
This allows students to view their transcript directly from the application.
We adopted an agile software development methodology characterized by iterative development and frequent testing to ensure alignment with the needs of both institutions and students. 
Our application is developed using a combination of programming languages, including JavaScript (utilized in React Native IDE) and Python. 
We employed a relational database, using dummy data for code testing to validate various functionalities.
Other terminologies integral to the development process are:
VS Code: The integrated development environment (IDE) utilized for coding the backend.
Figma: A collaborative web application employed for sharing interface designs early in the project. This facilitated consensus on the most suitable design for the project.
Android Studio Emulator: A virtual device, or emulator, used for running and testing our application to identify and rectify code errors.
MTN Momo API: Integration of the payment system was achieved through the MTN Momo API. This API enables the acceptance of payments for document processing.
